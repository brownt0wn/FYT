Description:

   This package aims at providing users an intuitive and easy to use API to run 
   Bittorrent programs capable of creating and publishing torrent files, downloading
   them and also retrieving target files described in a torrent file.

   The package comes along with 4 simple example classes that implement each a 
   distinct part of the protocol:

      ExampleCreateTorrent: create a new torrent file
      ExamplePublish: publish a torrent file on smartorrent.com or a tracker using 
                      trackerBT (provided with Java Bittorrent API and available on 
                         http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitext
      ExampleShareFiles: share files described in a torrent file with other people
      ExampleDownloadFiles: download and upload files described in a torrent

Compilation:
   
   - Compile the files simply using java command from the src directory. For example, from a console using:
        javac jBittorrentAPI/*.java

Execution of the examples:
   - ExampleCreateTorrent: to be executed, the program needs some input parameters. 
     Therefore, the command to launch the execution is (from the src directory):
        java jBittorrentAPI.ExampleCreateTorrent <torrentPath> <announceURL> <pieceLength> <filePath1> ... <filePathN> <..> <creator> <..> <comment>
     Information about the parameters:
       - <torrentPath>: the path and name of the file the torrent will be saved as. 
         Must end with .torrent extension. No space in it
       - <announceURL>: the announce url of the tracker the user want the torrent 
         to be published. No space in it.
       - <pieceLength>: length of the pieces in kB (default=256kB) the target files 
         will be split into. Must be an integer.
       - <filePathX>: the path and name of the Xth file to be inserted in the 
         torrent. If there is more than one such parameter, the first one must 
         only be the name of the directory the target files will be saved into 
         when a client downloads them.
       - <..>: represent the string ".." and is used to separate parameters.
       - <creator>: the name of the creator of the torrent. Recommended is that 
         it represent the name and version of the program that created it.
       - <comment>: comment about the torrent

     Depending on the size of the target files and the piece length, the process 
     can take some time.

     Note here that for an easiest publishing process, the target files should be 
     put in the download directory that you will used for file sharing before creating the 
     torrent. That's because to share the target files, they have to be located in 
     the download directory of the client. Therefore, copying it before simplifies 
     the process. Note also that there is no restriction on the directory tree to 
     access the target files
   
   - ExamplePublish: to be executed, the program needs some input parameters. 
     Therefore, the command to launch the execution is:
        java jBittorrentAPI.ExamplePublish <torrentPath> <trackerURL> <username> <password> <comment>
     Information about the parameters:
       - <torrentPath>: the path and name of the torrent the user wants to publish.
       - <trackerURL>: the url of the tracker accepting torrent upload. Note here 
         that for the moment, publishing is only possible on smartorrent tracker or 
         on a host running the trackerBT tracker.
       - <username>: the username registered on the tracker
       - <password>: the password registered on the tracker
       - <comment>: comment about the torrent, it will serve as a description for 
         people searching for torrents.

   - ExampleDownloadFiles and ExampleShareFiles: to be executed the program needs only the torrent 
     path. Therefore, the command to launch the execution is:
        java jBittorrentAPI.ExampleDownloadFiles <torrentPath> [<savingDirectory>]
        java jBittorrentAPI.ExampleShareFiles <torrentPath> [<savingDirectory>]

     The savingDirectory parameter is optional and permit to choose in which directory
     the downloaded files will be saved or in the case of sharing, in which directory 
     the shared files are located. By default they are saved in a directory 
     called "downloads/" in the working directory.

     These examples are the implementation of a bittorrent client. Therefore it 
     permit to share files with other bittorrent clients. Not only this program can 
     get files from other peers, but it is also necessary to seed the target files 
     the user wants to publish. Therefore, just after publishing the torrent file on 
     a tracker, the users would run this program so that other peers can download 
     the target files just published.
